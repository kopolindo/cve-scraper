CVE-2014-3626  DESCRIPTION:  The Grails Resource Plugin often has to exchange URIs for resources with other internal components. Those other components will decode any URI passed to them. To protect against directory traversal the Grails Resource Plugin did the following: normalized the URI, checked the normalized URI did not step outside the appropriate root directory (e.g. the web application root), decoded the URI and checked that this did not introduce additional /../ (and similar) sequences. A bug was introduced where the Grails Resource Plugin before 1.2.13 returned the decoded version of the URI rather than the normalized version of the URI after the directory traversal check. This exposed a double decoding vulnerability. To address this issue, the Grails Resource Plugin now repeatedly decodes the URI up to three times or until decoding no longer changes the URI. If the decode limit of 3 is exceeded the URI is rejected. A side-effect of this is that the Grails Resource Plugin is unable to serve a resource that includes a '%' character in the full path to the resource. Not all environments are vulnerable because of the differences in URL resolving in different servlet containers. Applications deployed to Tomcat 8 and Jetty 9 were found not not be vulnerable, however applications deployed to JBoss EAP 6.3 / JBoss AS 7.4 and JBoss AS 7.1 were found to be vulnerable (other JBoss versions weren't tested). In certain cases JBoss returns JBoss specific vfs protocol urls from URL resolution methods (ClassLoader.getResources). The JBoss vfs URL protocol supports resolving any file on the filesystem. This made the directory traversal possible. There may be other containers, in addition to JBoss, on which this vulnerability is exposed.

CVE-2017-1000084  DESCRIPTION:  Parameterized Trigger Plugin fails to check Item/Build permission: The Parameterized Trigger Plugin did not check the build authentication it was running as and allowed triggering any other project in Jenkins.
CVE-2017-1000085  DESCRIPTION:  Subversion Plugin connects to a user-specified Subversion repository as part of form validation (e.g. to retrieve a list of tags). This functionality improperly checked permissions, allowing any user with Item/Build permission (but not Item/Configure) to connect to any web server or Subversion server and send credentials with a known ID, thereby possibly capturing them. Additionally, this functionality did not require POST requests be used, thereby allowing the above to be performed without direct access to Jenkins via Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
CVE-2017-1000086  DESCRIPTION:  The Periodic Backup Plugin did not perform any permission checks, allowing any user with Overall/Read access to change its settings, trigger backups, restore backups, download backups, and also delete all previous backups via log rotation. Additionally, the plugin was not requiring requests to its API be sent via POST, thereby opening itself to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
CVE-2017-1000087  DESCRIPTION:  GitHub Branch Source provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring a job to select the one they'd like to use. This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.
CVE-2017-1000088  DESCRIPTION:  The Sidebar Link plugin allows users able to configure jobs, views, and agents to add entries to the sidebar of these objects. There was no input validation, which meant users were able to use javascript: schemes for these links.
CVE-2017-1000089  DESCRIPTION:  Builds in Jenkins are associated with an authentication that controls the permissions that the build has to interact with other elements in Jenkins. The Pipeline: Build Step Plugin did not check the build authentication it was running as and allowed triggering any other project in Jenkins.
CVE-2017-1000090  DESCRIPTION:  Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin was not requiring requests to its API be sent via POST, thereby opening itself to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. This allowed attackers to add administrator role to any user, or to remove the authorization configuration, preventing legitimate access to Jenkins.
CVE-2017-1000091  DESCRIPTION:  GitHub Branch Source Plugin connects to a user-specified GitHub API URL (e.g. GitHub Enterprise) as part of form validation and completion (e.g. to verify Scan Credentials are correct). This functionality improperly checked permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to any web server and send credentials with a known ID, thereby possibly capturing them. Additionally, this functionality did not require POST requests be used, thereby allowing the above to be performed without direct access to Jenkins via Cross-Site Request Forgery.
CVE-2017-1000092  DESCRIPTION:  Git Plugin connects to a user-specified Git repository as part of form validation. An attacker with no direct access to Jenkins but able to guess at a username/password credentials ID could trick a developer with job configuration permissions into following a link with a maliciously crafted Jenkins URL which would result in the Jenkins Git client sending the username and password to an attacker-controlled server.
CVE-2017-1000093  DESCRIPTION:  Poll SCM Plugin was not requiring requests to its API be sent via POST, thereby opening itself to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. This allowed attackers to initiate polling of projects with a known name. While Jenkins in general does not consider polling to be a protection-worthy action as it's similar to cache invalidation, the plugin specifically adds a permission to be able to use this functionality, and this issue undermines that permission.
CVE-2017-1000094  DESCRIPTION:  Docker Commons Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring a job to select the one they'd like to use to authenticate with a Docker Registry. This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.
CVE-2017-1000095  DESCRIPTION:  The default whitelist included the following unsafe entries: DefaultGroovyMethods.putAt(Object, String, Object); DefaultGroovyMethods.getAt(Object, String). These allowed circumventing many of the access restrictions implemented in the script sandbox by using e.g. currentBuild['rawBuild'] rather than currentBuild.rawBuild. Additionally, the following entries allowed accessing private data that would not be accessible otherwise due to script security: groovy.json.JsonOutput.toJson(Closure); groovy.json.JsonOutput.toJson(Object).
CVE-2017-1000096  DESCRIPTION:  Arbitrary code execution due to incomplete sandbox protection: Constructors, instance variable initializers, and instance initializers in Pipeline scripts were not subject to sandbox protection, and could therefore execute arbitrary code. This could be exploited e.g. by regular Jenkins users with the permission to configure Pipelines in Jenkins, or by trusted committers to repositories containing Jenkinsfiles.
CVE-2017-1000097  DESCRIPTION:  On Darwin, user's trust preferences for root certificates were not honored. If the user had a root certificate loaded in their Keychain that was explicitly not trusted, a Go program would still verify a connection using that root certificate.
CVE-2017-1000098  DESCRIPTION:  The net/http package's Request.ParseMultipartForm method starts writing to temporary files once the request body size surpasses the given "maxMemory" limit. It was possible for an attacker to generate a multipart request crafted such that the server ran out of file descriptors.
CVE-2017-1000099  DESCRIPTION:  When asking to get a file from a file:// URL, libcurl provides a feature that outputs meta-data about the file using HTTP-like headers. The code doing this would send the wrong buffer to the user (stdout or the application's provide callback), which could lead to other private data from the heap to get inadvertently displayed. The wrong buffer was an uninitialized memory area allocated on the heap and if it turned out to not contain any zero byte, it would continue and display the data following that buffer in memory.
CVE-2017-10001  DESCRIPTION:  Vulnerability in the Oracle Hospitality Simphony First Edition component of Oracle Hospitality Applications (subcomponent: Core). The supported version that is affected is 1.7.1. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Hospitality Simphony First Edition. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Hospitality Simphony First Edition accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Hospitality Simphony First Edition accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle Hospitality Simphony First Edition. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 7.6 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H).
CVE-2017-1000100  DESCRIPTION:  When doing a TFTP transfer and curl/libcurl is given a URL that contains a very long file name (longer than about 515 bytes), the file name is truncated to fit within the buffer boundaries, but the buffer size is still wrongly updated to use the untruncated length. This too large value is then used in the sendto() call, making curl attempt to send more data than what is actually put into the buffer. The endto() function will then read beyond the end of the heap based buffer. A malicious HTTP(S) server could redirect a vulnerable libcurl-using client to a crafted TFTP URL (if the client hasn't restricted which protocols it allows redirects to) and trick it to send private memory contents to a remote server over UDP. Limit curl's redirect protocols with --proto-redir and libcurl's with CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS.
CVE-2017-1000101  DESCRIPTION:  curl supports "globbing" of URLs, in which a user can pass a numerical range to have the tool iterate over those numbers to do a sequence of transfers. In the globbing function that parses the numerical range, there was an omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if given a carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is stored in a heap based buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read something else instead of crashing. An example of a URL that triggers the flaw would be `http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`.
CVE-2017-1000102  DESCRIPTION:  The Details view of some Static Analysis Utilities based plugins, was vulnerable to a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability: Malicious users able to influence the input to these plugins, for example the console output which is parsed to extract build warnings (Warnings Plugin), could insert arbitrary HTML into this view.
CVE-2017-1000103  DESCRIPTION:  The custom Details view of the Static Analysis Utilities based DRY Plugin, was vulnerable to a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability: Malicious users able to influence the input to this plugin could insert arbitrary HTML into this view.
CVE-2017-1000104  DESCRIPTION:  The Config File Provider Plugin is used to centrally manage configuration files that often include secrets, such as passwords. Users with only Overall/Read access to Jenkins were able to access URLs directly that allowed viewing these files. Access to view these files now requires sufficient permissions to configure the provided files, view the configuration of the folder in which the configuration files are defined, or have Job/Configure permissions to a job able to use these files.
CVE-2017-1000105  DESCRIPTION:  The optional Run/Artifacts permission can be enabled by setting a Java system property. Blue Ocean did not check this permission before providing access to archived artifacts, Item/Read permission was sufficient.
CVE-2017-1000106  DESCRIPTION:  Blue Ocean allows the creation of GitHub organization folders that are set up to scan a GitHub organization for repositories and branches containing a Jenkinsfile, and create corresponding pipelines in Jenkins. Its SCM content REST API supports the pipeline creation and editing feature in Blue Ocean. The SCM content REST API did not check the current user's authentication or credentials. If the GitHub organization folder was created via Blue Ocean, it retained a reference to its creator's GitHub credentials. This allowed users with read access to the GitHub organization folder to create arbitrary commits in the repositories inside the GitHub organization corresponding to the GitHub organization folder with the GitHub credentials of the creator of the organization folder. Additionally, users with read access to the GitHub organization folder could read arbitrary file contents from the repositories inside the GitHub organization corresponding to the GitHub organization folder if the branch contained a Jenkinsfile (which could be created using the other part of this vulnerability), and they could provide the organization folder name, repository name, branch name, and file name.
CVE-2017-1000107  DESCRIPTION:  Script Security Plugin did not apply sandboxing restrictions to constructor invocations via positional arguments list, super constructor invocations, method references, and type coercion expressions. This could be used to invoke arbitrary constructors and methods, bypassing sandbox protection.
CVE-2017-1000108  DESCRIPTION:  The Pipeline: Input Step Plugin by default allowed users with Item/Read access to a pipeline to interact with the step to provide input. This has been changed, and now requires users to have the Item/Build permission instead.
CVE-2017-1000109  DESCRIPTION:  The custom Details view of the Static Analysis Utilities based OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin, was vulnerable to a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability: Malicious users able to influence the input to this plugin could insert arbitrary HTML into this view.
CVE-2017-1000110  DESCRIPTION:  Blue Ocean allows the creation of GitHub organization folders that are set up to scan a GitHub organization for repositories and branches containing a Jenkinsfile, and create corresponding pipelines in Jenkins. It did not properly check the current user's authentication and authorization when configuring existing GitHub organization folders. This allowed users with read access to the GitHub organization folder to reconfigure it, including changing the GitHub API endpoint for the organization folder to an attacker-controlled server to obtain the GitHub access token, if the organization folder was initially created using Blue Ocean.
CVE-2017-1000111  DESCRIPTION:  Linux kernel: heap out-of-bounds in AF_PACKET sockets. This new issue is analogous to previously disclosed CVE-2016-8655. In both cases, a socket option that changes socket state may race with safety checks in packet_set_ring. Previously with PACKET_VERSION. This time with PACKET_RESERVE. The solution is similar: lock the socket for the update. This issue may be exploitable, we did not investigate further. As this issue affects PF_PACKET sockets, it requires CAP_NET_RAW in the process namespace. But note that with user namespaces enabled, any process can create a namespace in which it has CAP_NET_RAW.
CVE-2017-1000112  DESCRIPTION:  Linux kernel: Exploitable memory corruption due to UFO to non-UFO path switch. When building a UFO packet with MSG_MORE __ip_append_data() calls ip_ufo_append_data() to append. However in between two send() calls, the append path can be switched from UFO to non-UFO one, which leads to a memory corruption. In case UFO packet lengths exceeds MTU, copy = maxfraglen - skb->len becomes negative on the non-UFO path and the branch to allocate new skb is taken. This triggers fragmentation and computation of fraggap = skb_prev->len - maxfraglen. Fraggap can exceed MTU, causing copy = datalen - transhdrlen - fraggap to become negative. Subsequently skb_copy_and_csum_bits() writes out-of-bounds. A similar issue is present in IPv6 code.

CVE-2017-1000251  DESCRIPTION:  The native Bluetooth stack in the Linux Kernel (BlueZ), starting at the Linux kernel version 2.6.32 and up to and including 4.13.1, are vulnerable to a stack overflow vulnerability in the processing of L2CAP configuration responses resulting in Remote code execution in kernel space.
CVE-2017-1000252  DESCRIPTION:  The KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.13.3 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (assertion failure, and hypervisor hang or crash) via an out-of bounds guest_irq value, related to arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c and virt/kvm/eventfd.c.
CVE-2017-1000253  DESCRIPTION:  Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm->mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm->mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm->mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.
CVE-2017-1000254  DESCRIPTION:  libcurl may read outside of a heap allocated buffer when doing FTP. When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005. In libcurl version 7.56.0, the parser always zero terminates the string but also rejects it if not terminated properly with a final double quote.
CVE-2017-1000255  DESCRIPTION:  On Linux running on PowerPC hardware (Power8 or later) a user process can craft a signal frame and then do a sigreturn so that the kernel will take an exception (interrupt), and use the r1 value *from the signal frame* as the kernel stack pointer. As part of the exception entry the content of the signal frame is written to the kernel stack, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary locations with arbitrary values. The exception handling does produce an oops, and a panic if panic_on_oops=1, but only after kernel memory has been over written. This flaw was introduced in commit: "5d176f751ee3 (powerpc: tm: Enable transactional memory (TM) lazily for userspace)" which was merged upstream into v4.9-rc1. Please note that kernels built with CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n are not vulnerable.
CVE-2017-1000256  DESCRIPTION:  libvirt version 2.3.0 and later is vulnerable to a bad default configuration of "verify-peer=no" passed to QEMU by libvirt resulting in a failure to validate SSL/TLS certificates by default.
CVE-2017-1000257  DESCRIPTION:  An IMAP FETCH response line indicates the size of the returned data, in number of bytes. When that response says the data is zero bytes, libcurl would pass on that (non-existing) data with a pointer and the size (zero) to the deliver-data function. libcurl's deliver-data function treats zero as a magic number and invokes strlen() on the data to figure out the length. The strlen() is called on a heap based buffer that might not be zero terminated so libcurl might read beyond the end of it into whatever memory lies after (or just crash) and then deliver that to the application as if it was actually downloaded.
CVE-2017-10003  DESCRIPTION:  Vulnerability in the Solaris component of Oracle Sun Systems Products Suite (subcomponent: Network Services Library). The supported version that is affected is 10. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Solaris executes to compromise Solaris. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Solaris accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Solaris accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Solaris. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.5 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).
CVE-2017-1000353  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier are vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution. An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability allowed attackers to transfer a serialized Java `SignedObject` object to the Jenkins CLI, that would be deserialized using a new `ObjectInputStream`, bypassing the existing blacklist-based protection mechanism. We're fixing this issue by adding `SignedObject` to the blacklist. We're also backporting the new HTTP CLI protocol from Jenkins 2.54 to LTS 2.46.2, and deprecating the remoting-based (i.e. Java serialization) CLI protocol, disabling it by default.
CVE-2017-1000354  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier are vulnerable to a login command which allowed impersonating any Jenkins user. The `login` command available in the remoting-based CLI stored the encrypted user name of the successfully authenticated user in a cache file used to authenticate further commands. Users with sufficient permission to create secrets in Jenkins, and download their encrypted values (e.g. with Job/Configure permission), were able to impersonate any other Jenkins user on the same instance.
CVE-2017-1000355  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier are vulnerable to an XStream: Java crash when trying to instantiate void/Void.
CVE-2017-1000356  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier are vulnerable to an issue in the Jenkins user database authentication realm: create an account if signup is enabled; or create an account if the victim is an administrator, possibly deleting the existing default admin user in the process and allowing a wide variety of impacts.
CVE-2017-1000357  DESCRIPTION:  Denial of Service attack when the switch rejects to receive packets from the controller. Component: This vulnerability affects OpenDaylight odl-l2switch-switch, which is the feature responsible for the OpenFlow communication. Version: OpenDaylight versions 3.3 (Lithium-SR3), 3.4 (Lithium-SR4), 4.0 (Beryllium), 4.1 (Beryllium-SR1), 4.2 (Beryllium-SR2), and 4.4 (Beryllium-SR4) are affected by this flaw. Java version is openjdk version 1.8.0_91.
CVE-2017-1000358  DESCRIPTION:  Controller throws an exception and does not allow user to add subsequent flow for a particular switch. Component: OpenDaylight odl-restconf feature contains this flaw. Version: OpenDaylight 4.0 is affected by this flaw.
CVE-2017-1000359  DESCRIPTION:  Java out of memory error and significant increase in resource consumption. Component: OpenDaylight odl-mdsal-xsql is vulnerable to this flaw. Version: The tested versions are OpenDaylight 3.3 and 4.0.
CVE-2017-1000360  DESCRIPTION:  StreamCorruptedException and NullPointerException in OpenDaylight odl-mdsal-xsql. Controller launches exceptions in the console. Component: OpenDaylight odl-mdsal-xsql is vulnerable to this flaw. Version: The tested versions are OpenDaylight 3.3 and 4.0.
CVE-2017-1000361  DESCRIPTION:  DOMRpcImplementationNotAvailableException when sending Port-Status packets to OpenDaylight. Controller launches exceptions and consumes more CPU resources. Component: OpenDaylight is vulnerable to this flaw. Version: The tested versions are OpenDaylight 3.3 and 4.0.
CVE-2017-1000362  DESCRIPTION:  The re-key admin monitor was introduced in Jenkins 1.498 and re-encrypted all secrets in JENKINS_HOME with a new key. It also created a backup directory with all old secrets, and the key used to encrypt them. These backups were world-readable and not removed afterwards. Jenkins now deletes the backup directory, if present. Upgrading from before 1.498 will no longer create a backup directory. Administrators relying on file access permissions in their manually created backups are advised to check them for the directory $JENKINS_HOME/jenkins.security.RekeySecretAdminMonitor/backups, and delete it if present.
CVE-2017-1000363  DESCRIPTION:  Linux drivers/char/lp.c Out-of-Bounds Write. Due to a missing bounds check, and the fact that parport_ptr integer is static, a 'secure boot' kernel command line adversary (can happen due to bootloader vulns, e.g. Google Nexus 6's CVE-2016-10277, where due to a vulnerability the adversary has partial control over the command line) can overflow the parport_nr array in the following code, by appending many (>LP_NO) 'lp=none' arguments to the command line.
CVE-2017-1000364  DESCRIPTION:  An issue was discovered in the size of the stack guard page on Linux, specifically a 4k stack guard page is not sufficiently large and can be "jumped" over (the stack guard page is bypassed), this affects Linux Kernel versions 4.11.5 and earlier (the stackguard page was introduced in 2010).
CVE-2017-1000365  DESCRIPTION:  The Linux Kernel imposes a size restriction on the arguments and environmental strings passed through RLIMIT_STACK/RLIM_INFINITY (1/4 of the size), but does not take the argument and environment pointers into account, which allows attackers to bypass this limitation. This affects Linux Kernel versions 4.11.5 and earlier. It appears that this feature was introduced in the Linux Kernel version 2.6.23.
CVE-2017-1000366  DESCRIPTION:  glibc contains a vulnerability that allows specially crafted LD_LIBRARY_PATH values to manipulate the heap/stack, causing them to alias, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution. Please note that additional hardening changes have been made to glibc to prevent manipulation of stack and heap memory but these issues are not directly exploitable, as such they have not been given a CVE. This affects glibc 2.25 and earlier.
CVE-2017-1000367  DESCRIPTION:  Todd Miller's sudo version 1.8.20 and earlier is vulnerable to an input validation (embedded spaces) in the get_process_ttyname() function resulting in information disclosure and command execution.
CVE-2017-1000368  DESCRIPTION:  Todd Miller's sudo version 1.8.20p1 and earlier is vulnerable to an input validation (embedded newlines) in the get_process_ttyname() function resulting in information disclosure and command execution.
CVE-2017-1000369  DESCRIPTION:  Exim supports the use of multiple "-p" command line arguments which are malloc()'ed and never free()'ed, used in conjunction with other issues allows attackers to cause arbitrary code execution. This affects exim version 4.89 and earlier. Please note that at this time upstream has released a patch (commit 65e061b76867a9ea7aeeb535341b790b90ae6c21), but it is not known if a new point release is available that addresses this issue at this time.
CVE-2017-1000370  DESCRIPTION:  The offset2lib patch as used in the Linux Kernel contains a vulnerability that allows a PIE binary to be execve()'ed with 1GB of arguments or environmental strings then the stack occupies the address 0x80000000 and the PIE binary is mapped above 0x40000000 nullifying the protection of the offset2lib patch. This affects Linux Kernel version 4.11.5 and earlier. This is a different issue than CVE-2017-1000371. This issue appears to be limited to i386 based systems.
CVE-2017-1000371  DESCRIPTION:  The offset2lib patch as used by the Linux Kernel contains a vulnerability, if RLIMIT_STACK is set to RLIM_INFINITY and 1 Gigabyte of memory is allocated (the maximum under the 1/4 restriction) then the stack will be grown down to 0x80000000, and as the PIE binary is mapped above 0x80000000 the minimum distance between the end of the PIE binary's read-write segment and the start of the stack becomes small enough that the stack guard page can be jumped over by an attacker. This affects Linux Kernel version 4.11.5. This is a different issue than CVE-2017-1000370 and CVE-2017-1000365. This issue appears to be limited to i386 based systems.
CVE-2017-1000372  DESCRIPTION:  A flaw exists in OpenBSD's implementation of the stack guard page that allows attackers to bypass it resulting in arbitrary code execution using setuid binaries such as /usr/bin/at. This affects OpenBSD 6.1 and possibly earlier versions.
CVE-2017-1000373  DESCRIPTION:  The OpenBSD qsort() function is recursive, and not randomized, an attacker can construct a pathological input array of N elements that causes qsort() to deterministically recurse N/4 times. This allows attackers to consume arbitrary amounts of stack memory and manipulate stack memory to assist in arbitrary code execution attacks. This affects OpenBSD 6.1 and possibly earlier versions.
CVE-2017-1000374  DESCRIPTION:  A flaw exists in NetBSD's implementation of the stack guard page that allows attackers to bypass it resulting in arbitrary code execution using certain setuid binaries. This affects NetBSD 7.1 and possibly earlier versions.
CVE-2017-1000375  DESCRIPTION:  NetBSD maps the run-time link-editor ld.so directly below the stack region, even if ASLR is enabled, this allows attackers to more easily manipulate memory leading to arbitrary code execution. This affects NetBSD 7.1 and possibly earlier versions.
CVE-2017-1000376  DESCRIPTION:  libffi requests an executable stack allowing attackers to more easily trigger arbitrary code execution by overwriting the stack. Please note that libffi is used by a number of other libraries. It was previously stated that this affects libffi version 3.2.1 but this appears to be incorrect. libffi prior to version 3.1 on 32 bit x86 systems was vulnerable, and upstream is believed to have fixed this issue in version 3.1.
CVE-2017-1000377  DESCRIPTION:  An issue was discovered in the size of the default stack guard page on PAX Linux (originally from GRSecurity but shipped by other Linux vendors), specifically the default stack guard page is not sufficiently large and can be "jumped" over (the stack guard page is bypassed), this affects PAX Linux Kernel versions as of June 19, 2017 (specific version information is not available at this time).
CVE-2017-1000378  DESCRIPTION:  The NetBSD qsort() function is recursive, and not randomized, an attacker can construct a pathological input array of N elements that causes qsort() to deterministically recurse N/4 times. This allows attackers to consume arbitrary amounts of stack memory and manipulate stack memory to assist in arbitrary code execution attacks. This affects NetBSD 7.1 and possibly earlier versions.
CVE-2017-1000379  DESCRIPTION:  The Linux Kernel running on AMD64 systems will sometimes map the contents of PIE executable, the heap or ld.so to where the stack is mapped allowing attackers to more easily manipulate the stack. Linux Kernel version 4.11.5 is affected.
CVE-2017-1000380  DESCRIPTION:  sound/core/timer.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11.5 is vulnerable to a data race in the ALSA /dev/snd/timer driver resulting in local users being able to read information belonging to other users, i.e., uninitialized memory contents may be disclosed when a read and an ioctl happen at the same time.
CVE-2017-1000381  DESCRIPTION:  The c-ares function `ares_parse_naptr_reply()`, which is used for parsing NAPTR responses, could be triggered to read memory outside of the given input buffer if the passed in DNS response packet was crafted in a particular way.
CVE-2017-1000382  DESCRIPTION:  VIM version 8.0.1187 (and other versions most likely) ignores umask when creating a swap file ("[ORIGINAL_FILENAME].swp") resulting in files that may be world readable or otherwise accessible in ways not intended by the user running the vi binary.
CVE-2017-1000383  DESCRIPTION:  GNU Emacs version 25.3.1 (and other versions most likely) ignores umask when creating a backup save file ("[ORIGINAL_FILENAME]~") resulting in files that may be world readable or otherwise accessible in ways not intended by the user running the emacs binary.
CVE-2017-1000385  DESCRIPTION:  The Erlang otp TLS server answers with different TLS alerts to different error types in the RSA PKCS #1 1.5 padding. This allows an attacker to decrypt content or sign messages with the server's private key (this is a variation of the Bleichenbacher attack).
CVE-2017-1000386  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins Active Choices plugin version 1.5.3 and earlier allowed users with Job/Configure permission to provide arbitrary HTML to be shown on the 'Build With Parameters' page through the 'Active Choices Reactive Reference Parameter' type. This could include, for example, arbitrary JavaScript. Active Choices now sanitizes the HTML inserted on the 'Build With Parameters' page if and only if the script is executed in a sandbox. As unsandboxed scripts are subject to administrator approval, it is up to the administrator to allow or disallow problematic script output.
CVE-2017-1000387  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins Build-Publisher plugin version 1.21 and earlier stores credentials to other Jenkins instances in the file hudson.plugins.build_publisher.BuildPublisher.xml in the Jenkins master home directory. These credentials were stored unencrypted, allowing anyone with local file system access to access them. Additionally, the credentials were also transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the credentials through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.
CVE-2017-1000388  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins Dependency Graph Viewer plugin 0.12 and earlier did not perform permission checks for the API endpoint that modifies the dependency graph, allowing anyone with Overall/Read permission to modify this data.
CVE-2017-1000389  DESCRIPTION:  Some URLs provided by Jenkins global-build-stats plugin version 1.4 and earlier returned a JSON response that contained request parameters. These responses had the Content Type: text/html, so could have been interpreted as HTML by clients, resulting in a potential reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. Additionally, some URLs provided by global-build-stats plugin that modify data did not require POST requests to be sent, resulting in a potential cross-site request forgery vulnerability.
CVE-2017-1000390  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins Multijob plugin version 1.25 and earlier did not check permissions in the Resume Build action, allowing anyone with Job/Read permission to resume the build.
CVE-2017-1000391  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins versions 2.88 and earlier and 2.73.2 and earlier stores metadata related to 'people', which encompasses actual user accounts, as well as users appearing in SCM, in directories corresponding to the user ID on disk. These directories used the user ID for their name without additional escaping, potentially resulting in problems like overwriting of unrelated configuration files.
CVE-2017-1000392  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins 2.88 and earlier; 2.73.2 and earlier Autocompletion suggestions for text fields were not escaped, resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability if the source for the suggestions allowed specifying text that includes HTML metacharacters like less-than and greater-than characters.
CVE-2017-1000393  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier users with permission to create or configure agents in Jenkins could configure a launch method called 'Launch agent via execution of command on master'. This allowed them to run arbitrary shell commands on the master node whenever the agent was supposed to be launched. Configuration of this launch method now requires the Run Scripts permission typically only granted to administrators.
CVE-2017-1000394  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier bundled a version of the commons-fileupload library with the denial-of-service vulnerability known as CVE-2016-3092. The fix for that vulnerability has been backported to the version of the library bundled with Jenkins.
CVE-2017-1000395  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier provides information about Jenkins user accounts which is generally available to anyone with Overall/Read permissions via the /user/(username)/api remote API. This included e.g. Jenkins users' email addresses if the Mailer Plugin is installed. The remote API now no longer includes information beyond the most basic (user ID and name) unless the user requesting it is a Jenkins administrator.
CVE-2017-1000396  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier bundled a version of the commons-httpclient library with the vulnerability CVE-2012-6153 that incorrectly verified SSL certificates, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. This library is widely used as a transitive dependency in Jenkins plugins. The fix for CVE-2012-6153 was backported to the version of commons-httpclient that is bundled in core and made available to plugins.
CVE-2017-1000397  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins Maven Plugin 2.17 and earlier bundled a version of the commons-httpclient library with the vulnerability CVE-2012-6153 that incorrectly verified SSL certificates, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Maven Plugin 3.0 no longer has a dependency on commons-httpclient.
CVE-2017-1000398  DESCRIPTION:  The remote API in Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier at /computer/(agent-name)/api showed information about tasks (typically builds) currently running on that agent. This included information about tasks that the current user otherwise has no access to, e.g. due to lack of Item/Read permission. This has been fixed, and the API now only shows information about accessible tasks.
CVE-2017-1000399  DESCRIPTION:  The Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier remote API at /queue/item/(ID)/api showed information about tasks in the queue (typically builds waiting to start). This included information about tasks that the current user otherwise has no access to, e.g. due to lack of Item/Read permission. This has been fixed, and the API endpoint is now only available for tasks that the current user has access to.
CVE-2017-10004  DESCRIPTION:  Vulnerability in the Solaris component of Oracle Sun Systems Products Suite (subcomponent: Kernel). Supported versions that are affected are 10 and 11. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Solaris executes to compromise Solaris. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Solaris. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.7 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
CVE-2017-1000400  DESCRIPTION:  The Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier remote API at /job/(job-name)/api contained information about upstream and downstream projects. This included information about tasks that the current user otherwise has no access to, e.g. due to lack of Item/Read permission. This has been fixed, and the API now only lists upstream and downstream projects that the current user has access to.
CVE-2017-1000401  DESCRIPTION:  The Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier default form control for passwords and other secrets, <f:password/>, supports form validation (e.g. for API keys). The form validation AJAX requests were sent via GET, which could result in secrets being logged to a HTTP access log in non-default configurations of Jenkins, and made available to users with access to these log files. Form validation for <f:password/> is now always sent via POST, which is typically not logged.
CVE-2017-1000402  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins Swarm Plugin Client 3.4 and earlier bundled a version of the commons-httpclient library with the vulnerability CVE-2012-6153 that incorrectly verified SSL certificates, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
CVE-2017-1000403  DESCRIPTION:  Jenkins Speaks! Plugin, all current versions, allows users with Job/Configure permission to run arbitrary Groovy code inside the Jenkins JVM, effectively elevating privileges to Overall/Run Scripts.
CVE-2017-1000404  DESCRIPTION:  The Jenkins Delivery Pipeline Plugin version 1.0.7 and earlier used the unescaped content of the query parameter 'fullscreen' in its JavaScript, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability through specially crafted URLs.
CVE-2017-1000405  DESCRIPTION:  The Linux Kernel versions 2.6.38 through 4.14 have a problematic use of pmd_mkdirty() in the touch_pmd() function inside the THP implementation. touch_pmd() can be reached by get_user_pages(). In such case, the pmd will become dirty. This scenario breaks the new can_follow_write_pmd()'s logic - pmd can become dirty without going through a COW cycle. This bug is not as severe as the original "Dirty cow" because an ext4 file (or any other regular file) cannot be mapped using THP. Nevertheless, it does allow us to overwrite read-only huge pages. For example, the zero huge page and sealed shmem files can be overwritten (since their mapping can be populated using THP). Note that after the first write page-fault to the zero page, it will be replaced with a new fresh (and zeroed) thp.
CVE-2017-1000406  DESCRIPTION:  OpenDaylight Karaf 0.6.1-Carbon fails to clear the cache after a password change, allowing the old password to be used until the Karaf cache is manually cleared (e.g. via restart).
CVE-2017-1000407  DESCRIPTION:  The Linux Kernel 2.6.32 and later are affected by a denial of service, by flooding the diagnostic port 0x80 an exception can be triggered leading to a kernel panic.
CVE-2017-1000408  DESCRIPTION:  A memory leak in glibc 2.1.1 (released on May 24, 1999) can be reached and amplified through the LD_HWCAP_MASK environment variable. Please note that many versions of glibc are not vulnerable to this issue if patched for CVE-2017-1000366.
CVE-2017-1000409  DESCRIPTION:  A buffer overflow in glibc 2.5 (released on September 29, 2006) and can be triggered through the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. Please note that many versions of glibc are not vulnerable to this issue if patched for CVE-2017-1000366.
CVE-2017-1000410  DESCRIPTION:  The Linux kernel version 3.3-rc1 and later is affected by a vulnerability lies in the processing of incoming L2CAP commands - ConfigRequest, and ConfigResponse messages. This info leak is a result of uninitialized stack variables that may be returned to an attacker in their uninitialized state. By manipulating the code flows that precede the handling of these configuration messages, an attacker can also gain some control over which data will be held in the uninitialized stack variables. This can allow him to bypass KASLR, and stack canaries protection - as both pointers and stack canaries may be leaked in this manner. Combining this vulnerability (for example) with the previously disclosed RCE vulnerability in L2CAP configuration parsing (CVE-2017-1000251) may allow an attacker to exploit the RCE against kernels which were built with the above mitigations. These are the specifics of this vulnerability: In the function l2cap_parse_conf_rsp and in the function l2cap_parse_conf_req the following variable is declared without initialization: struct l2cap_conf_efs efs; In addition, when parsing input configuration parameters in both of these functions, the switch case for handling EFS elements may skip the memcpy call that will write to the efs variable: ... case L2CAP_CONF_EFS: if (olen == sizeof(efs)) memcpy(&efs, (void *)val, olen); ... The olen in the above if is attacker controlled, and regardless of that if, in both of these functions the efs variable would eventually be added to the outgoing configuration request that is being built: l2cap_add_conf_opt(&ptr, L2CAP_CONF_EFS, sizeof(efs), (unsigned long) &efs); So by sending a configuration request, or response, that contains an L2CAP_CONF_EFS element, but with an element length that is not sizeof(efs) - the memcpy to the uninitialized efs variable can be avoided, and the uninitialized variable would be returned to the attacker (16 bytes).
CVE-2017-1000411  DESCRIPTION:  OpenFlow Plugin and OpenDayLight Controller versions Nitrogen, Carbon, Boron, Robert Varga, Anil Vishnoi contain a flaw when multiple 'expired' flows take up the memory resource of CONFIG DATASTORE which leads to CONTROLLER shutdown. If multiple different flows with 'idle-timeout' and 'hard-timeout' are sent to the Openflow Plugin REST API, the expired flows will eventually crash the controller once its resource allocations set with the JVM size are exceeded. Although the installed flows (with timeout set) are removed from network (and thus also from controller's operations DS), the expired entries are still present in CONFIG DS. The attack can originate both from NORTH or SOUTH. The above description is for a north bound attack. A south bound attack can originate when an attacker attempts a flow flooding attack and since flows come with timeouts, the attack is not successful. However, the attacker will now be successful in CONTROLLER overflow attack (resource consumption). Although, the network (actual flow tables) and operational DS are only (~)1% occupied, the controller requests for resource consumption.

CVE-2017-1000481  DESCRIPTION:  When you visit a page where you need to login, Plone 2.5-5.1rc1 sends you to the login form with a 'came_from' parameter set to the previous url. After you login, you get redirected to the page you tried to view before. An attacker might try to abuse this by letting you click on a specially crafted link. You would login, and get redirected to the site of the attacker, letting you think that you are still on the original Plone site. Or some javascript of the attacker could be executed. Most of these types of attacks are already blocked by Plone, using the `isURLInPortal` check to make sure we only redirect to a page on the same Plone site. But a few more ways of tricking Plone into accepting a malicious link were discovered, and fixed with this hotfix.
CVE-2017-1000482  DESCRIPTION:  A member of the Plone 2.5-5.1rc1 site could set javascript in the home_page property of his profile, and have this executed when a visitor click the home page link on the author page.
CVE-2017-1000483  DESCRIPTION:  Accessing private content via str.format in through-the-web templates and scripts in Plone 2.5-5.1rc1. This improves an earlier hotfix. Since the format method was introduced in Python 2.6, this part of the hotfix is only relevant for Plone 4 and 5.
CVE-2017-1000484  DESCRIPTION:  By linking to a specific url in Plone 2.5-5.1rc1 with a parameter, an attacker could send you to his own website. On its own this is not so bad: the attacker could more easily link directly to his own website instead. But in combination with another attack, you could be sent to the Plone login form and login, then get redirected to the specific url, and then get a second redirect to the attacker website. (The specific url can be seen by inspecting the hotfix code, but we don't want to make it too easy for attackers by spelling it out here.)

CVE-2017-12634  DESCRIPTION:  The camel-castor component in Apache Camel 2.x before 2.19.4 and 2.20.x before 2.20.1 is vulnerable to Java object de-serialisation vulnerability. De-serializing untrusted data can lead to security flaws.
CVE-2017-12635  DESCRIPTION:  Due to differences in the Erlang-based JSON parser and JavaScript-based JSON parser, it is possible in Apache CouchDB before 1.7.0 and 2.x before 2.1.1 to submit _users documents with duplicate keys for 'roles' used for access control within the database, including the special case '_admin' role, that denotes administrative users. In combination with CVE-2017-12636 (Remote Code Execution), this can be used to give non-admin users access to arbitrary shell commands on the server as the database system user. The JSON parser differences result in behaviour that if two 'roles' keys are available in the JSON, the second one will be used for authorising the document write, but the first 'roles' key is used for subsequent authorization for the newly created user. By design, users can not assign themselves roles. The vulnerability allows non-admin users to give themselves admin privileges.
CVE-2017-12636  DESCRIPTION:  CouchDB administrative users can configure the database server via HTTP(S). Some of the configuration options include paths for operating system-level binaries that are subsequently launched by CouchDB. This allows an admin user in Apache CouchDB before 1.7.0 and 2.x before 2.1.1 to execute arbitrary shell commands as the CouchDB user, including downloading and executing scripts from the public internet.

CVE-2017-14098  DESCRIPTION:  In the pjsip channel driver (res_pjsip) in Asterisk 13.x before 13.17.1 and 14.x before 14.6.1, a carefully crafted tel URI in a From, To, or Contact header could cause Asterisk to crash.
CVE-2017-14099  DESCRIPTION:  In res/res_rtp_asterisk.c in Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.2, 13.x before 13.17.1, and 14.x before 14.6.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert17 and 13.x before 13.13-cert5, unauthorized data disclosure (media takeover in the RTP stack) is possible with careful timing by an attacker. The "strictrtp" option in rtp.conf enables a feature of the RTP stack that learns the source address of media for a session and drops any packets that do not originate from the expected address. This option is enabled by default in Asterisk 11 and above. The "nat" and "rtp_symmetric" options (for chan_sip and chan_pjsip, respectively) enable symmetric RTP support in the RTP stack. This uses the source address of incoming media as the target address of any sent media. This option is not enabled by default, but is commonly enabled to handle devices behind NAT. A change was made to the strict RTP support in the RTP stack to better tolerate late media when a reinvite occurs. When combined with the symmetric RTP support, this introduced an avenue where media could be hijacked. Instead of only learning a new address when expected, the new code allowed a new source address to be learned at all times. If a flood of RTP traffic was received, the strict RTP support would allow the new address to provide media, and (with symmetric RTP enabled) outgoing traffic would be sent to this new address, allowing the media to be hijacked. Provided the attacker continued to send traffic, they would continue to receive traffic as well.
CVE-2017-14100  DESCRIPTION:  In Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.2, 13.x before 13.17.1, and 14.x before 14.6.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert17 and 13.x before 13.13-cert5, unauthorized command execution is possible. The app_minivm module has an "externnotify" program configuration option that is executed by the MinivmNotify dialplan application. The application uses the caller-id name and number as part of a built string passed to the OS shell for interpretation and execution. Since the caller-id name and number can come from an untrusted source, a crafted caller-id name or number allows an arbitrary shell command injection.
CVE-2017-14101  DESCRIPTION:  A security researcher found an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability on the Conserus Image Repository archive solution version 2.1.1.105 by McKesson Medical Imaging Company, which is now a Change Healthcare company.

CVE-2017-15051  DESCRIPTION:  Multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 allow authenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) URL value of an item or (2) user log history. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must be first authenticated to the application. For the first one, the attacker has to simply inject XSS code within the URL field of a shared item. For the second one however, the attacker must prepare a payload within its profile, and then ask an administrator to modify its profile. From there, whenever the administrator accesses the log, it can be XSS'ed.
CVE-2017-15052  DESCRIPTION:  TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce manager access control when requesting users.queries.php. It is then possible for a manager user to delete an arbitrary user (including admin), or modify attributes of any arbitrary user except administrator. To exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker must have the manager rights on the application, then tamper with the requests sent directly, for example by changing the "id" parameter when invoking "delete_user" on users.queries.php.
CVE-2017-15053  DESCRIPTION:  TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce manager access control when requesting roles.queries.php. It is then possible for a manager user to modify any arbitrary roles within the application, or delete any arbitrary role. To exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker must have the manager rights on the application, then tamper with the requests sent directly, for example by changing the "id" parameter when invoking "delete_role" on roles.queries.php.
CVE-2017-15054  DESCRIPTION:  An arbitrary file upload vulnerability, present in TeamPass before 2.1.27.9, allows remote authenticated users to upload arbitrary files leading to Remote Command Execution. To exploit this vulnerability, an authenticated attacker has to tamper with parameters of a request to upload.files.php, in order to select the correct branch and be able to upload any arbitrary file. From there, it can simply access the file to execute code on the server.
CVE-2017-15055  DESCRIPTION:  TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce item access control when requesting items.queries.php. It is then possible to copy any arbitrary item into a directory controlled by the attacker, edit any item within a read-only directory, delete an arbitrary item, delete the file attachments of an arbitrary item, copy the password of an arbitrary item to the copy/paste buffer, access the history of an arbitrary item, and edit attributes of an arbitrary directory. To exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker must tamper with the requests sent directly, for example by changing the "item_id" parameter when invoking "copy_item" on items.queries.php.

CVE-2017-1571  DESCRIPTION:  IBM DB2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows (includes DB2 Connect Server) 9.7, 10.1, 10.5, and 11.1 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information. IBM X-Force ID: 131853.
CVE-2017-15710  DESCRIPTION:  In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, mod_authnz_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.
CVE-2017-15712  DESCRIPTION:  Vulnerability allows a user of Apache Oozie 3.1.3-incubating to 4.3.0 and 5.0.0-beta1 to expose private files on the Oozie server process.

The injection point is the add/create input field and the execution point occurs in the item listing after the add or create.
CVE-2017-16636  DESCRIPTION:  In Bludit v1.5.2 and v2.0.1, an XSS vulnerability is located in the new page, new category, and edit post function body message context. Remote attackers are able to bypass the basic editor validation to trigger cross site scripting. The XSS is persistent and the request method to inject via editor is GET. To save the editor context, the followup POST method request must be processed to perform the attack via the application side. The basic validation of the editor does not allow injecting script codes and blocks the context. Attackers can inject the code by using an editor tag that is not recognized by the basic validation. Thus allows a restricted user account to inject malicious script code to perform a persistent attack against higher privilege web-application user accounts.
CVE-2017-16637  DESCRIPTION:  In Vectura Perfect Privacy VPN Manager v1.10.10 and v1.10.11, when resetting the network data via the software client, with a running VPN connection, a critical error occurs which leads to a "FrmAdvancedProtection" crash. Although the mechanism malfunctions and an error occurs during the runtime with the stack trace being issued, the software process is not properly terminated. The software client is still attempting to maintain the connection even though the network connection information is being reset live. In that insecure mode, the "FrmAdvancedProtection" component crashes, but the process continues to run with different errors and process corruptions. This local corruption vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers.

CVE-2017-17433  DESCRIPTION:  The recv_files function in receiver.c in the daemon in rsync 3.1.2, and 3.1.3-development before 2017-12-03, proceeds with certain file metadata updates before checking for a filename in the daemon_filter_list data structure, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
CVE-2017-17434  DESCRIPTION:  The daemon in rsync 3.1.2, and 3.1.3-development before 2017-12-03, does not check for fnamecmp filenames in the daemon_filter_list data structure (in the recv_files function in receiver.c) and also does not apply the sanitize_paths protection mechanism to pathnames found in "xname follows" strings (in the read_ndx_and_attrs function in rsync.c), which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
CVE-2017-17435  DESCRIPTION:  An issue was discovered in the software on Vaultek Gun Safe VT20i products, aka BlueSteal. An attacker can remotely unlock any safe in this product line without a valid PIN code. Even though the phone application requires it and there is a field to supply the PIN code in an authorization request, the safe does not check the PIN code, so an attacker can obtain authorization using any value. Once an attacker sees the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisement for the safe, they need only to write a BLE characteristic to enable notifications, and send a crafted getAuthor packet that returns a temporary key, and an unlock packet including that temporary key. The safe then opens after the unlock packet is processed, with no verification of PIN or other credentials.
CVE-2017-17436  DESCRIPTION:  An issue was discovered in the software on Vaultek Gun Safe VT20i products. There is no encryption of the session between the Android application and the safe. The website and marketing materials advertise that this communication channel is encrypted with "Highest Level Bluetooth Encryption" and "Data transmissions are secure via AES256 bit encryption." These claims, however, are not true. Moreover, AES256 bit encryption is not supported in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard, so it would have to be at the application level. This lack of encryption allows an individual to learn the passcode by eavesdropping on the communications between the application and the safe.
CVE-2017-17439  DESCRIPTION:  In Heimdal through 7.4, remote unauthenticated attackers are able to crash the KDC by sending a crafted UDP packet containing empty data fields for client name or realm. The parser would unconditionally dereference NULL pointers in that case, leading to a segmentation fault. This is related to the _kdc_as_rep function in kdc/kerberos5.c and the der_length_visible_string function in lib/asn1/der_length.c.
CVE-2017-17440  DESCRIPTION:  GNU Libextractor 1.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted GIF, IT (Impulse Tracker), NSFE, S3M (Scream Tracker 3), SID, or XM (eXtended Module) file, as demonstrated by the EXTRACTOR_xm_extract_method function in plugins/xm_extractor.c.

CVE-2017-17910  DESCRIPTION:  On Hoermann BiSecur devices before 2018, a vulnerability can be exploited by recording a single radio transmission. An attacker can intercept an arbitrary radio frame exchanged between a BiSecur transmitter and a receiver to obtain the encrypted packet and the 32-bit serial number. The interception of the one-time pairing process is specifically not required. Due to use of AES-128 with an initial static random value and static data vector (all of this static information is the same across different customers' installations), the attacker can easily derive the utilized encryption key and decrypt the intercepted packet. The key can be verified by decrypting the intercepted packet and checking for known plaintext. Subsequently, an attacker can create arbitrary radio frames with the correct encryption key to control BiSecur garage and entrance gate operators and possibly other BiSecur systems as well ("wireless cloning"). To conduct the attack, a low cost Software Defined Radio (SDR) is sufficient. This affects Hoermann Hand Transmitter HS5-868-BS, HSE1-868-BS, and HSE2-868-BS devices.

CVE-2017-6926  DESCRIPTION:  In Drupal versions 8.4.x versions before 8.4.5 users with permission to post comments are able to view content and comments they do not have access to, and are also able to add comments to this content. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the comment system must be enabled and the attacker must have permission to post comments.
CVE-2017-6927  DESCRIPTION:  Drupal 8.4.x versions before 8.4.5 and Drupal 7.x versions before 7.57 has a Drupal.checkPlain() JavaScript function which is used to escape potentially dangerous text before outputting it to HTML (as JavaScript output does not typically go through Twig autoescaping). This function does not correctly handle all methods of injecting malicious HTML, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability under certain circumstances. The PHP functions which Drupal provides for HTML escaping are not affected.
CVE-2017-6928  DESCRIPTION:  Drupal core 7.x versions before 7.57 when using Drupal's private file system, Drupal will check to make sure a user has access to a file before allowing the user to view or download it. This check fails under certain conditions in which one module is trying to grant access to the file and another is trying to deny it, leading to an access bypass vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs for unusual site configurations.
CVE-2017-6929  DESCRIPTION:  A jQuery cross site scripting vulnerability is present when making Ajax requests to untrusted domains. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it requires contributed or custom modules in order to exploit. For Drupal 8, this vulnerability was already fixed in Drupal 8.4.0 in the Drupal core upgrade to jQuery 3. For Drupal 7, it is fixed in the current release (Drupal 7.57) for jQuery 1.4.4 (the version that ships with Drupal 7 core) as well as for other newer versions of jQuery that might be used on the site, for example using the jQuery Update module.
CVE-2017-6930  DESCRIPTION:  In Drupal versions 8.4.x versions before 8.4.5 when using node access controls with a multilingual site, Drupal marks the untranslated version of a node as the default fallback for access queries. This fallback is used for languages that do not yet have a translated version of the created node. This can result in an access bypass vulnerability. This issue is mitigated by the fact that it only applies to sites that a) use the Content Translation module; and b) use a node access module such as Domain Access which implement hook_node_access_records().
CVE-2017-6931  DESCRIPTION:  In Drupal versions 8.4.x versions before 8.4.5 the Settings Tray module has a vulnerability that allows users to update certain data that they do not have the permissions for. If you have implemented a Settings Tray form in contrib or a custom module, the correct access checks should be added. This release fixes the only two implementations in core, but does not harden against other such bypasses. This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the Settings Tray module.
CVE-2017-6932  DESCRIPTION:  Drupal core 7.x versions before 7.57 has an external link injection vulnerability when the language switcher block is used.

CVE-2018-1000005  DESCRIPTION:  libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 contains an out bounds read in code handling HTTP/2 trailers. It was reported (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added after the colon) but the following math wasn't updated correspondingly. When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.

CVE-2018-1000007  DESCRIPTION:  libcurl 7.1 through 7.57.0 might accidentally leak authentication data to third parties. When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP requests, libcurl will send that set of headers first to the host in the initial URL but also, if asked to follow redirects and a 30X HTTP response code is returned, to the host mentioned in URL in the `Location:` response header value. Sending the same set of headers to subsequest hosts is in particular a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` headers, as this header often contains privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others to impersonate the libcurl-using client's request.

CVE-2018-1000030  DESCRIPTION:  Python 2.7.14 is vulnerable to a Heap-Buffer-Overflow as well as a Heap-Use-After-Free. Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.
